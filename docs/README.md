![example](example.png)

currently a wip collection of sub projects all holstered in this one menu bar.

intended project goals are to improve productivity for my own personal workflow by hijacking osx's spaces management with the help of a binary tree window manager a la bspwm kwm or chunk.

nifty plug and play style, with planned features such as:

*   utilizing my mouth of kift project for interfacing with ncmcpp and mopidy for music viz goodness.

*   dmenu, rofi, alfred-esque runner for spotlighting.

*   42 api connectivity. (hours, corrections, etc.)

so you randomly stumbled upon this and youre wondering...

Q:
why not just roll arch and just use what already exists?

A: because i won't learn anything that way silly.


all the above mentions will most likely start off as standalones for the standard mac menubar and get worked in here.
